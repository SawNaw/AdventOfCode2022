# AdventOfCode2022

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge designed to leverage pure programming and problem-solving aptitude. No computer science knowledge is required other than varying degrees of competency in a programming language of your choice. Knowledge of data structures, algorithms and programming techniques will help you design more elegant solutions, but they are by no means required.

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2022, in C#, .NET 7. 

All solutions are test-driven.
