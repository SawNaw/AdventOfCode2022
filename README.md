# AdventOfCode2022
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 programming challenges, in C#, .NET 7. I've tried to design them as if they were going into production.

My own [NuGet package for conditional collection splitting]([https://github.com/SawNaw/EnumerableSplit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SawNaw.LinqExtensions.EnumerableSplit/)) is used in a couple of cases.

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge designed to leverage pure programming and problem-solving aptitude. No computer science background is required other than varying degrees of competency in a programming language of your choice.
